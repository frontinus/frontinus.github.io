Welcome to my website.
My name is Francesco Abate, and I am an Italian computer engineer specializing in cybersecurity. Over the course of my career, I have worked as an avionic software engineer in the aerospace industry, as an embedded software engineer within my university’s student team (where I also serve as an officer), and conducted research in computer networks during my master’s thesis. I am currently expanding my expertise in the field of artificial intelligence.

This website serves as a collection of articles and updates about my professional activities, research interests, and projects. While I strive to keep it current, my ongoing commitments and new initiatives often keep me busy.

Thank you for visiting. I hope you find the content informative and engaging.
