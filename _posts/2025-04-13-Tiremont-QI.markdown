This is a short article to share a video I found interesting. While this website primarily serves to showcase my **projects as a computer engineer**, I also enjoy sharing more personal interests occasionally, like this one.

The video discusses **IQ** and, more broadly, presents the significant **challenges our societies face** in pursuing prosperity and happiness. I particularly appreciate its efficient presentation and the interesting perspectives it offers on topics often overlooked or treated superficially.

The video is in **French**, which, as mentioned on my [About page](https://frontinus.github.io/about), is one of my native languages. I may add English subtitles in the future.
