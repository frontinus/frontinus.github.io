## Welcome to my website

My name is **Francesco Abate**. Iâ€™m a computer engineer originally from Italy, but having grown up in France and with Argentinian ancestry.

Having attended an international school, I speak:

* **ITALIAN**
* **FRENCH**
* **ENGLISH**
* **SPANISH**

I currently work in a large Italian defence company as an **Avionic Software Engineer**. My work focuses on the software for the **C27J Spartan** aircraft, where I implement new functionalities and fix bugs.

In parallel, I lead the embedded engineers' team for the **Polito Rocket Team** at Politecnico di Torino. In this role, I am the main developer and architect for our **SRAD** (Student Researched and Developed) board's firmware. This involves writing the code and ensuring it meets all functional and timing requirements for successful rocket flights, as well as managing the small team of embedded software engineers.

All of this while completing my Master's studies in Computer Engineering at **Politecnico di Torino**.

I also have a keen interest in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions, particularly in cryptography. I participated in the **CyberChallenge.IT** program and previously won a CTF organized by my university. I plan to post write-ups here for interesting challenges I solve from time to time.

Finally, I am increasingly involved in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I was part of the winning team at the **HackaPizza** hackathon on Generative AI, hosted by IBM in Milan. I will share insights from my thesis and various AI projects on this blog.
